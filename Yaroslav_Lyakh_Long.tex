\osection{Career History}
\jobdes{Betfair: London, UK} {March 2015 - Present}{Principal Java Consultant}
{Low-latency high-throughput systems based on low-level Java 7 and 8 multi-threading primitives (locks/barriers/phaser, Guava Monitor) and concurrent collections. Oracle SQL and PL/SQL. Zookeeper. Raft distributed consensus algorithm. Continuous Integration (CI) with Jenkins and Thoughtworks Go. TDD (TestNG + Mockito), Maven, Spring, Git, Scrum, peer reviews, mentoring junior team members}
\begin{itemize}
 \item In an Agile environment, developed new functionality for a large-scale, high-volume Bet Matching module with so-called Virtual Bets and One-Way Matching extensions.
 \item Heavily involved in so-called ``Multiple Orchestrator'' project - a major development effort which enabled a significant increase in the degree of parallelism for the whole Bet Matching subsystem.
 \item Designed and implemented a project-specific Performance Testing facility.
 \item Heavily involved in transition of the current Oracle-based ``traditional'' (i.e. built on classical read-process-write cycle) Matcher implementation into more robust stream-based architecture based on Raft distributed consensus algorithm.
 \item Provided training and on-the-fly consultations to the junior team members.
 \end{itemize}

\jobdes{ION Trading: London, UK} {July 2013 - March 2015}{Senior Software Developer}
{Java 7, distributed multithreaded low-latency systems. Continuous Integration (CI) with Jenkins, Acceptance Testing with the Robot Framework. Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI), TDD (jUnit + Mockito), VisualVM, Maven, Git, Groovy, Scrum, Subversion, peer reviews}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Re-designed the Query Execution module as a distributed parallel executing subsystem.
 \item Enhanced the Continuous Integration infrastructure, re-implemented a project-specific Maven plugins. Streamlined the existed Robot Framework modules which increased the test reliability and reduced the test execution time.
 \item Implemented the Attribute Replacement feature which greatly improved the system’s configuration flexibility and made administering and configuring of the whole product much more convenient.
 \end{itemize}

\jobdes{Fizzback (now NICE Co): London, UK} {June 2011 - July 2013}{Senior Software Engineer}
{Java 6, multi-threading, Spring (Core, Spring Integration, SpEL, Spring Roo), Hibernate, Activiti BPM, Groovy, jUnit, Mockito, VisualVM, Maven, Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs), Python (Jython) SMS-based mobile communicating, Mac OS, Linux, Scrum, peer reviews}
\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt % reduce space between items
 \item Refactored and enhanced a set of modules enabling a massive multi-threading data processing on top of Spring Integration pipelines.
\ifFullVersion
While for some modules it was enough to re-code the critical pieces with the standard “stateless or immutable” approach, the main part of existed system required deep re-design based on Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP) messaging-based architecture and extensive use of Java multi-threading tools.
\fi
The changes in performance and resource consumption were constantly monitored using jMeter and VisualVM.
 \item Redeveloped a database access layer, got rid of locking-related problems.
\ifFullVersion
Some modules were completely re-built until the required level of performance and reliability was achieved.
\fi
 \item In addition to the scalability improvements deeply re-developed the Communication and Reporting sub-modules to make them more convenient in configuration and maintenance.
\ifFullVersion
   These changes (like introducing ad-hoc configuration DSL and flexible report templates) greatly improved overall system's maintainability and customer provisioning time.
\fi
Improved the execution time of the whole Unit Testing process (mostly by database-related optimisation).
\ifFullVersion
Initiated use of CI service (Jenkins) as a key component of the team’s Scrum Agile methodology approach.
\fi
 \item Developed good working relations with colleagues from Operations, QA, and Customer Support departments. Combined with good ``pure'' development work this decreased an average defect response time and improved overall IT team flexibility and confidence.

\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt % reduce space between items
 \item Designed and implemented various parts of a major Web Security system based on a set of parallel running services being executed in a cloud environment.
 \ifFullVersion
   This included a lot of re-design work, particularly switching from the standard Java objects to the immutable structures in combination with elements of functional-oriented programming.
\fi
Data structures like tries and algorithm tricks like specifically built hash functions were used to provide the required scalability level.
 \item Implemented Data Analysis and Reporting modules with sophisticated “on-the-fly” SQL query building. Provided the serious database performance tuning including query re-writing, some PL/SQL programming and index optimisation.
